### Part 1: Introduction to Generative AI with AI Chef

In this introductory section, you’ll learn the basics of **GenAI** through the AI Chef project, where we focus on building a **recipe generator** application. This exercise will help you gain hands-on experience with foundational tasks, including:

- Setting up a Streamlit interface for user interaction
- Connecting to NVIDIA's LLM API using LangChain
- Implementing and evaluating model-generated recipes based on user preferences
- Logging interactions and evaluation metrics for deeper insights into model performance

Through incremental steps, you'll build a fully functional AI Chef application, gaining an understanding of GenAI’s role in real-world applications.

**AI Chef** serves as an illustrative project for exploring GenAI capabilities. By building a recipe generator, you'll see how generative models can handle user-specific requests, such as dietary restrictions or ingredient preferences. This interactive project not only demonstrates model training but also offers practical experience in creating a personalized user experience.
